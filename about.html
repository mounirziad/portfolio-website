      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m <strong>Mounir Ziad</strong>, a game developer who loves building systems that bring worlds to life. 
        My work sits at the intersection of <strong>technical design and creative direction</strong> — I enjoy taking ideas from concept to implementation, shaping gameplay that feels intuitive, responsive, and meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in <strong>AI programming, character systems, and modular gameplay architecture</strong>, 
        but I also have a deep appreciation for the artistry behind games — from composing music and designing cutscenes to fine-tuning player feedback and flow. 
        Whether working solo or in a team, I focus on creating experiences that balance <strong>precision, emotion, and playability</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What drives me most is the process itself — that moment when a mechanic clicks, a system feels alive, and the game starts to breathe on its own. 
        Every project is a chance to learn, experiment, and refine the craft of interactive storytelling.
